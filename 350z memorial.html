            This was the first photo I ever took of Daisy. I had a friend drive
            it to the gas station due to my lack of a license. Also, I remember
            only spending 40 bucks to fill up—such a memory!

            This is when I installed my favorite set of wheels. Daisy was more
            than just a car to me.

            Exhaust, exhaust! I remember wanting a loud car so badly, but I
            didn’t want it to be annoyingly loud, so I spent the extra coin.

              A1: Daisy was a 2008 model, best year in my opinion in terms of
              tech and looks, also HR engine.

              A5: "It ended up being a total loss, sadly, and I was cashed out
              for the estimated value of the car. They let me keep her, but I
              just didn’t really have the time nor the financial resources to
              fix her, so I sold her to a young man that did."
